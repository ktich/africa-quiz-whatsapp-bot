# Africa Quiz Bot

## Created by Kim Tichmann
*6 July 2020*

A WhatsApp bot to improve your knowledge of African countries. Right now, the bot helps you memorize capital cities! Eventually, I'd like to include a timer so it will be a timed quiz.

### Tools
- Python 3
- Twilio
- PostgresSQL
- Flask

### Resources
https://www.twilio.com/blog/build-a-whatsapp-chatbot-with-python-flask-and-twilio

### Usage
I'm using the WhatsApp sandbox on Twilio because I don't own a company/organisation. So to check out the app, send 'join compass-gently' to +1 415 523 8886. Then send 'hi'.
